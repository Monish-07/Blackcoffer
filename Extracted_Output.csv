So, nature agents, researchers began study nature intelligence itself. question test validate intelligence? test intelligence solve cognitive problems. agent intelligent solve complex problem. problem-solving approach easily tested validated computers. Thus, researchers began studying ideal intelligence, selected agent validate experiments computer. So, computer problem-solving approach adopted. So, human-centered approach computer, problem-solving approach aims AI. contributed giving valuable insights. aims important collaboratively form aim AI! problem-solving approach, big challenge overcome order achieve aim. solving math problem. cases intelligence tested problem-solving approach. math problems solve. problem familiar problem not. problem. problem familiar you, solve kind problems solved similar problems past. So, question, mind solve problem? answer is, solved similar problems past, learned past data, solve problems, haven’t problem past, solve similar problems. form intelligence. problem solved kind problems past. solve problem, consciously gather manipulate information reach conclusion. kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process. kind intelligence. build intelligent agents, kinds intelligence developed agent. But, reality reached point build agents learn past data find information. today reached point build agents own. type intelligence. So, implement type intelligence Machine Learning! So, domain focuses solely implementing kind intelligence fact Machine Learning. reason ML called subset AI! So, difference ML. Technically speaking, “It study computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions, patterns explicitly programmed”. statement elaboration. essence ML related process “Generalization” learning past data. Generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims. humans recognize life objects. animal, easily recognize “dog” “cat”. trivial task wondered mind it? answer Generalization! picture dog, easily recognize picture dog, because, minds abstracted description dog formulated “concept” dog concepts learned past experiences dog. So, dependent fact things represented generalized concepts minds. generalization only, “information”. So, give computers ability generalize “raw data” convert “information” patterns trends data own. discipline concerns collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, presentation data. Statistics data aim explain it. So, study explaining data itself! Statistics domains Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics deals explanation description data “Descriptive” statistics. explain information possible, easily data complex task otherwise. Inferential statistics make accurate inferences data. inference tasks lives. simple cooking soup. completing recipe, taste sample, is, spoonful soup check soup tastes bad. Depending result sample, make inference soup soup whole, bad. Similarly, statistics, cases apply inference meaningful information. example, gather data time-consuming costly. cases, applying inference based introduces uncertainty. inferential statistics help. So, data context uncertainty decision-making face uncertainty statistics deals with. So, however, data, statistics explain data. aim resonate ML, statistics correctly interpret data! “Data”, raw form. examples sensors industrial applications. sensors manufacturing sense properties temperature, pressure, etc. raw data generated sensors converted suitable form, processed, analyzed gather valuable insights, solve problem! Due unique aim capturing essence datasets, gather insights, Data Mining referred “Knowledge Discovery”. why, Fiorina, CEO Hewlett-Packard said, “The goal turn data information information Insight”. statement completely explains aim Data Mining! So, difference Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining lies aims. approaches fields, fulfilling aims fields. beauty fields! provide intelligence, accelerate innovation implement technology extraordinary breadth depth global insights big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, information management organizations combining unique, specialist services high-lvel human expertise.

Code Review Checklist Introduction definition consciousness controversial centuries, title ‘most familiar mysterious aspects lives’. idea concept awareness beings surroundings, themselves, perception. reason part mind remains unascertained consciousness isn’t observable, unlike matter studied scientifically. physical clarification awareness general sense incomplete: doesn’t include feels subject, subject. likewise accounts unbridgeable illustrative gap physical world consciousness. suggested incident Eastern Shamir traditions, consciousness universal primal. Whilst made tremendous progress understanding activity years, research hasn’t answer questions relating nature emotions experiences. History Beginning late nineteenth century, time psychological queries driven philosophical understanding mind, typically equated consciousness. result, analysis behavior naturally thought role consciousness behavioral management brain. Ancient Mayans propose sorted feeling degree consciousness, purpose, worldly association mankind. consciousness incorporates stimuli nature interior stimuli, Mayans trusted essential type existence, equipped evolution. Incas, however, thought consciousness movement mindfulness worry too. Locke, philosopher, consciousness, individuality, freelanced substances. detected reason consciousness stuck specific body mind, consciousness transferred body mind one. Marx, thinker, denies mind-body classification holds consciousness jeopardized material eventualities one’s settings. James, psychologist, differentiated consciousness stream – unbroken continuous shifts. center lot analysis moved strictly note behaviors primary half twentieth century, analysis human consciousness grown staggeringly 1950s. Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theory, believed levels awareness- preconscious, conscious, unconscious responsible one’s behavior thinking. believed mid divided parts- id, ego, superego. Id present birth, instinctual, operates pleasure principle. ego underseals reality logic develops id infancy. Finally, superego internalization society’s moral standards responsible guilt. Now, Id regarded unconscious, ego superego conscious preconscious. Freud constantly revised clinical qualities researches, however, didn’t conduct scientific experiments work heavily scrutinized, leaving questions unanswered. Sigmund Freud’s theory differed psychologists theories understandable easily conveyed people. Sigmund Freud’s work hypotheses helped people shape perspectives youth, character, memory, sexuality, therapy. However, theories subject considerable criticism life. Whilst practical approach mystery conducting experiments, Sigmund Freud didn’t provide evidence support claims. Today, essential focal point consciousness research understanding consciousness implies biologically mentally. Issues interest include phenomena perception, blindsight, brainwaves sleep, altered states consciousness produced psychoactive drugs. greater part test assesses consciousness approaching human subjects verbal report encounters. However, confirm criticalness verbal reports, researchers contrast action —that is, search neural connections consciousness. locate noticeable action specific aspect brain, pattern global activity, greatly predictive consciousness mindfulness. imaging strategies, example, EEG MRI scans, utilized physical proportions activities examinations. investigations shown movement essential primary sensory areas isn’t adequate create consciousness: workable subjects report absence awareness event, areas, example, primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions stimulus. Higher areas viewed encouraging, prefrontal cortex, involved order functions. mainstream theory implicates examples waves creating conditions consciousness. Analysts record mind waves, drawings electrical movement inside cerebrum, electroencephalograph (EEG) placing electrodes scalp. types waves (alpha, beta, theta, delta) correspond mental (relaxed, alert, lightly asleep, deeply asleep) Memory Episodic memory regarded form conscious memory. capacity consciously remember personally experienced events situations past. hippocampus located brain’s temporal lobe responsible type memory. Consciousness plays part important memory distinctions. distinction implicit explicit characteristics; explicit memory consciously implicit memory includes events conscious of. Furthermore, empirical findings suggest declarative memory related consciousness well; meaning retrieval formation memory connected awareness. Working memory operates/maintains consciously perceived information temporarily stores tampers information whilst working tasks. current ways testing information lacking essential aspects, including spatial resolution, temporal resolution, scope. Examples methods PET, fMRI, EEG, implanted electrodes, etc. PET fMRI temporal resolution problems, EEG well-known localizability difficulties, implanted electrodes whilst great temporal spatial resolution test set number neurons; is, restricted scope. Hence, huge speculations, testable fundamental level, difficult test now. Mental illness Consciousness influence objects us, encourages choices communicate them. Experiencing difficulty perceiving objects connected problems, example, agnosia (a failure decipher visual data), Alzheimer’s disease, autism. However, don’t comprehend visual data basic mind intentionally perceive object. disorders consciousness include locked-in syndrome, minimally conscious state, persistent vegetative state, chronic coma, death. Locked-in syndrome, called pseudo coma, condition patient aware can’t move impart verbally complete loss motion essentially voluntary muscles body vertical eye developments squinting. individual conscious speak eye movements. minimally conscious state, patient intermittent periods awareness wakefulness. Patients give restricted, reproducible indications consciousness themself current circumstance. straightforward orders, comprehensible speech, purposeful conduct. persistent vegetative state, patient sleep-wake cycles, lacks awareness, communicate, displays reflexive non-purposeful behavior. term refers organic body develop devoid intellectual activity social intercourse coma, chronic coma results generally cortical white-matter harm neuronal axonal injury, central brainstem sores. Usually, metabolism matter decreases 50-70% normal range. patient lies eyes shut doesn’t environmental factors. death irreversible end activity, function (including involuntary activity sustain life). total necrosis cerebral neurons loss oxygenation. death patient lacks sense awareness; sleep-wake cycles behavior, typically dead deep sleep state. Future predictions conclusion history scholar’s endeavors study consciousness empirically, nature defined scientific methods. past, psychologists Descartes dualistic theories line fundamental physics. realists illusionists, taking fundamentally impossible topic doesn’t concrete evidence. observe neural examinations detect consciousness, sensory sector aware event clear signs reaction stimulus. Similarly, consciousness plays role memory, lack facilities research fully. future, possibility access facilities, however, find neural connections ties mental illness well. people making aware perspective things, give recognizing signs mental illness issues beforehand. seems, researchers continue study unknown part mind fund recover global pandemic, answer psychology’s difficult questions. provide intelligence, accelerate innovation implement technology extraordinary breadth depth global insights big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, information management organizations combining unique, specialist services high-lvel human expertise.
